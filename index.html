      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>"To do good work with my hands, so that I may have something to share with someone in need."
          This notion is what drives me to learning new and exciting things. Sharing with others 
          builds within us a sense of fellow feeling, purpose, value. My desire is to 
          build a foundation founded on this principle. </p>
